                    ***README****
                    
This is a README for assignment 3. 

Instructions on how to run my program:
1. make
2. zero to run pq_HEAP
3. one to run pq_ONE
4. make clean to remove zero and one. 

I tried all the functions, but I didn't have the time to rigorously test it 
and try to break my program.
