                ****Design****
                
This is a design explanation on assignment 3. To start with, I chose to 
implement my classes pq_zero and pq_one into a single .H files-- pq_HEAP.H 
and pq_ZERO.H respectively. 

There are two test harnesses: one.cc and zero.cc. The reason why I made two is 
because I wanted to show that the index starts at one for the pq_one class 
instead of 0. 

Once I was able to get pq_ZERO.H to work, I made very minor changes to get
pq_ONE.H to work. Thus, the explanation on the functionality and logic refers
to both from here on.

I used many helper functions, such as parent, left_child, right_child, 
reset_index, print, reset_p, and build_heap on top of the helper functions 
already in the pseudo header file given in the assignment specs. 

For the most part, most of these helper functions are fairly obvious. For 
example, Parent returns the parent given an index i, print prints out the 
heap, priority map, and index map, reset index clears the index in a map 
and fills it in with the current heap index values.
