****README for Assignment 2 part 2

Essentially, the name of the program is the same as before, myshell.cc 

In order to run it, simply make using make and type in myshell into the command 
line.

What I was able to do:

I was able to get everything else but the correct background job id. I was able to get it
from the background because when I hit ctrl-c background job doesn't terminate, but I wasn't
able to get the job id for the background job. 2 Pipe, <, >, >>, and 2> seems to work from
what I've tested.
