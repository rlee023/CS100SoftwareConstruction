                              **** Design **** 

This is an explanation of my design for myshell Assignment 2, part 1.

I impleneted a basic shell using four main functions
        - parse function
        - execute funciton
        - signal handler function
        - main function

**** parse function ****

The parse function does exactly what it sounds like it does. It parses through the
command given by the user. It ignores things like new lines, spaces, and tabs and 
stores the rest of the commands into a char**. 

**** Execute function ****

The execute function also does exactly what one would expect it to do, it executes 
a command given by the user. It passes in a char** or char * [] and forks a new process.

**** Signal handler function ****

The signal handler is used to account for ctrl-c. Since this is a pseudo-shell, the
shell certainly shouldn't terminate if someone presses ctrl-c. 

**** main function ****

Essentially, the main function is the body. It calls the other three functions and performs and infinite loop in order to keep reading commands unless exit is passed into the 
command line. The main is also responsible for checking if the command passed in is cd 
or exit and is done using strcmp. If the command passed in is exit, I call exit(1). If
the command is cd, I use chdir to change to a directory if a path is specified. Otherwise,
I would go to the home directory.

All in all, that pretty much sums up how I designed my myshell! ;)
